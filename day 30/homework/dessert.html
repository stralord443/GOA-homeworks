    <p>The éclair originated during the 19th century in Lyon, France where it was called pain à la Duchesse ('Duchess-style bread') or petite duchesse ('little duchess') until 1850. The word is first attested both in English and in French in the 1860s.</p>

    <p>The earliest mention of the name mille-feuille itself appears in 1733 in an English-language cookbook written by French chef Vincent La Chapelle. The 18th century mille-feuille was served stuffed with jam and marmalade instead of cream.</p>

    <p>A recipe for a deep-fried dough ball was recorded by Cato the Elder in his De agri cultura, using cheese, honey, and poppy seeds, called globi. Similar types of fried dough recipes have either spread to, or originated, in other parts of Europe and the World.</p>
